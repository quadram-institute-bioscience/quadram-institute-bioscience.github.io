I am an evolutionary computational biologist specialised in Bayesian phylogenetics and microbial genomics. I also like multiomics, chemometrics, and data sciences.
I develop, implement, and streamline computational methods for the evolutionary analysis of microbial data sets.
I am active on [mastodon](https://mstdn.science/@leomrtns) and I maintain a [personal site with projects](https://leomrtns.github.io/).

Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher working on Evolutionary Genomics in [Dessimoz Group at the University of Lausanne](https://comparative-genomics.ch/), 
where I was also affiliated to the [Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB)](https://www.isb-sib.ch/). 
I have also worked with Hyperspectral Data Analysis at the [Stevens Group](https://www.stevensgroup.org/) (then at Imperial College London), 
and with large-scale Phylogenomics working with [David Posada at the University of Vigo](https://dposada.webs.uvigo.es/). 
I did my Ph.D. on Bayesian models for viral recombination at the [Laboratory of Biometry and Bioinformatics of the University of Tokyo](http://www.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/aeb/laboratory/bb_e.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Hirohisa Kishino](http://lbm.ab.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~kishino/).
