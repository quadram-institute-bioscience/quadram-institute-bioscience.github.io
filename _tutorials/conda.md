Conda is a package manager that helps you find and install software packages.

It is particularly useful for managing Python packages, but can also be used for other languages, and for managing non-Python software.

The [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel provides a large number of bioinformatics packages, and is a good place to start when looking for bioinformatics software.
